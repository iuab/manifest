Informatics WebApp ecosystem at the Univ Alabama at Birmingham. It uses the [wApps ecosystem](https://github.com/wApps/manifest#wapps-all-you-need-is-a-manifest) developed at the [Div Informatics](http://uab.mathbiol.org/informatics) of the Dept Pathology of UAB. A wApp is a "**webApp in a hurry to be integrated in a web application ecosystem**". As explained in that [documentation](https://github.com/wApps/manifest#wapps-all-you-need-is-a-manifest), the iUAB ecosystem relies on a single manifest file, maintained in this repository.
